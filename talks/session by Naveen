evolution of js for doing stuff form validation to now entire application

why backbone.js
- pre-requisities:
   dom,
   jquery (query, efficient query, events, custom events-(creating and triggering and passing data, event namespaceing),


understanding control flow


How DOM came into picture - object created and provided to Javascript.

on dom view takes stuff form model

polling is done on model by view - e.g. at interval see for changes. but this is expensive

view should only read not poll

view
model
controller/manager

router gets initiated and maps things for the controller. it contains the url pattern

deep-linking

for conventional web application router is a part of the controller
for single web applications its separate.
it is good practice to have it separate.


history api, hash change

router listens to hash change

placeholder is a string (an id) given to inner components of a hash


controller listens to url executes logic (if logic, http ajax requests)and shows the view

after data from ajax returns it is fed to model
divide the model (message.js) to two parts of collection and single message

--------------------x------------------
http verbs - get post put delete


model methods (in backbone) - fetch, save, sync



dom events and custom events
