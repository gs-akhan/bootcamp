Survery or Survery App
----------------------
Initially it was separate. Later on integrated. It was used for NPS service only.

back then, info was loaded to nps survery response and nps survey master and using formula values were aggregated.

based on results we do something more, we raise cta's

survey name means feedback

survey is very closely linked to rules engine and cockpit

cases are triggered
once there is a case and case is closed a feedback is taken
feedback is also taken for open pending cases

Also, when a build is released a feedback is initiated to be taken.


track responses, how to design a survey, publishing a survey all come under under survey




five (5) types of survey
--------------------
non anonymous, partial anonymous (account tracking; many number of people), complete anonymous

and, other than that two predefined surveys (implementation and nps survey)

-------------------------------
gainsight email services and marketo email services don't have any limit

while salesforce needs no configuration


mandrill is used for gainsight email services
marketo is a good tool for marketing automation
